## Version Control
Version Control Systems (VCS) is a program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files.</br>
Its goals are:
-  To easily recall earlier versions of individual files or the entire project.
-  To allow several team members to work on a project, files at the time without affecting each other's work.
Another name for VCS is *software configuration management (SCM) system.*</br>
With VCS you can:</br>
-  See changes made on project, when changes were made and by whom.
-  Create branches where changes can be made by different people performing actions at the same time like fixing bugs without affecting the main. Later on the changes can be merged if they are to be kept in the main branch.</br>
-  Retrive past versions of files or individual files.
-  Include comment with each change and explanation.

## Git
It is a distributed version control system that is free and open source that developers and other contributors can use to work on a project.</br>
